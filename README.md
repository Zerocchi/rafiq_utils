## mover.bat

How to use `mover` batch script

1. Move `mover.bat` to the directory of files you wish to move.
2. Open command prompt in current directory.
3. Type in the command as follow.

```bat
.\mover <start> <end> <step>
```

Example

```bat
.\mover 1 1000 10
```

will move *1.txt* until *1000.txt* into folders separated by 10 steps (1-10, 11-20, etc).

If step isn't specified, the default **10** will be used.

**üî¥IMPORTANT‚ùóüî¥: Make sure the naming of the files are correct, and the folders are not already existed. The script make neither effort to validate file names nor moving the files to the folder that already exist.**

## txt_gen.bat

**(OPTIONAL)**

Use `txt_gen` batch script to generate empty text files incrementally. Useful for testing `mover.bat` to ensure it's working correctly.

Usage:

```bat
.\txt_gen <amount>
```

Example:

```bat
.\txt_gen 1000
```

will generate *1.txt* until *1000.txt* into the current directory.
